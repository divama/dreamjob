Always looking for the perfect dream job, where I get the freedom to plan myself and create,
which is challenging and where I can leave my digital footprint,
in which I learn and grow through others, training and just doing,
in which everyone is an important link in the chain, regardless education or gender,
in which I have colleagues who are just like people, just like me.
It's about the result and the choices you made (together with your team) to get there, isn't it?

I have experience working with scrum in a team with developers, designers, quality engeneers and fellow front-enders, and have always been UX minded.
In addition, I care about people, am a strict person, like making plans, making lists, setting priorities and honour existing commitments.
